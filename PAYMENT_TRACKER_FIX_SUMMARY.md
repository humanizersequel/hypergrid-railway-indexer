# Payment Tracker Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Block Tracking Race Condition (Primary Issue)
**Problem**: The tracker was advancing `last_processed_block` even when no transactions were found, causing it to skip over transactions that hadn't been indexed by the API yet.

**Solution**: 
- Added current block height querying
- Implemented a safety buffer (default 10 blocks) to only process blocks that are likely fully indexed
- Only advance `last_processed_block` when we've actually scanned the range and can confirm there are no transactions

### 2. Error Handling
**Problem**: "No transactions found" was throwing an error instead of returning an empty array.

**Solution**: Fixed the error handling to check both `data.message` and `data.result` for the "No transactions found" response.

### 3. Provider Identity Tracking
**Problem**: The `hypermap_transactions` table only stored `provider_id`, but multiple provider entries can share the same provider ID.

**Solution**: Created a migration to add `provider_entry_name` to the transactions table for proper tracking.

## Changes Made

### Code Changes in payment-tracker.js:

1. **Added Block Safety Buffer**
   - New constant: `BLOCK_SAFETY_BUFFER` (default: 10 blocks)
   - Ensures we only process blocks that are old enough to be fully indexed

2. **Added getCurrentBlockHeight() Function**
   - Queries the current block height from Etherscan API
   - Uses eth_blockNumber RPC method

3. **Updated processProviderTransactions()**
   - Now accepts `safeBlockHeight` parameter
   - Only processes transactions up to the safe block height
   - Returns whether it reached the safe height
   - Properly advances block counter only when appropriate

4. **Updated Main Processing Loop**
   - Fetches current block height before processing
   - Calculates safe block height (current - buffer)
   - Only updates block counter when transactions are found OR when safe height is reached

5. **Added provider_entry_name to Transaction Records**
   - Transactions now include the full provider entry name for proper identification

### Database Migration Required

Run the following SQL file to update your database schema:

```bash
psql $PAYMENTS_DATABASE_URL < add-provider-entry-name.sql
```

This migration:
- Adds `provider_entry_name` column to `hypermap_transactions`
- Updates existing records with the correct provider entry names
- Adds an index for efficient queries

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables required, but you can optionally set:
- `BLOCK_SAFETY_BUFFER`: Number of blocks behind current to process (default: 10)

## How It Works Now

1. **Initial Backfill**: Works as before, processing all historical transactions
2. **Ongoing Polling**: 
   - Gets current block height
   - Calculates safe block height (current - 10)
   - Only processes up to safe block height
   - Only advances block counter when:
     - Transactions are found (advances to highest block seen)
     - OR no transactions found AND we've scanned up to safe height
   - Never advances past a block that might have unindexed transactions

## Expected Behavior

- The tracker will now lag 10 blocks behind the current chain height
- This ensures the API has time to index all transactions
- No more missed transactions due to race conditions
- Proper provider entry identification in transaction records

## Monitoring

New log messages will show:
- Current block height and safe processing height
- When providers are skipped because they're already up to date
- Actual block numbers being processed

Example:
```
Current block height: 12345678, processing up to block: 12345668
Processing provider betaprovidernode1.os (weatherapi.grid-beta.hypr)...
No new transactions for betaprovidernode1.os, updated to block: 12345668
```
